Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the automated detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in retinal images. DR is a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if left undetected. Early detection is crucial for preventing vision loss.

Installation
This project requires the following Python libraries:
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
You can install them using pip:

Bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib


Download the dataset:
The project currently does not include a dataset due to size and licensing restrictions. You can download a publicly available Diabetic Retinopathy dataset like the one from https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection and place it in a data folder within the project directory. The dataset should have separate folders for training and testing images.
This script will evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data. It will print metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Run the training script (train.ipynb):
Open the untitledt5.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google colab. This notebook performs the following steps:
  Loads the dataset (ensure the data path is set correctly)
  Preprocesses the images (resizing, normalization)
  Defines the CNN model architecture
  Compiles the model with optimizer and loss function
  Trains the model for 15 epochs (you can modify this in the notebook)
  Evaluates the model's performance on the testing data
